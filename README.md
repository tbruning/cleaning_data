cleaning_data
=============

This project is to complete the assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course as part of the Data Science Specialization track on Coursera.

The program file is: `data_analysis.R` and the data files must be in the working directory.  I completed this assignment utilizing only one .R file since it was easy to do and not a long program.
The document: "Codebook.md" has the particulars of how I created, edited and summarized the data for this course.

Happy Grading
