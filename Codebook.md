Getting and Cleaning Data Codebook


##Activities
All of the activities listed in the tidyMean.txt dataset were derived from the source files obtained from the course website under *Course Project*.
The Activities are:
- Walking - Mean
- Upstairs - Mean
- Downstairs - Mean
- Standing - Mean
- Sitting - Mean
- Laying - Mean


I thought it necessary to add the `- Mean` to each to let the casual reader of the data know it is derived data, not the source data
