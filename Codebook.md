Getting and Cleaning Data Codebook


##Activities
All of the activities listed in the tidyMean.txt dataset were derived from the source files obtained from the course website under *Course Project*.
The Activities are:
- **Walking - Mean** - value of the mean of all variables where the activity is walking.
- **Upstairs - Mean** - value of the mean of all variables where the activity is walking upstairs.
- **Downstairs - Mean** - value of the mean of all variables where the activity is walking downstairs.
- **Standing - Mean** - value of the mean of all variables where the activity is standing.
- **Sitting - Mean** - value of the mean of all variables where the activity is sitting.
- **Laying - Mean** - value of the mean of all activities where the activity is laying.


I thought it necessary to add the `- Mean` to each to let the casual reader of the data know it is derived data, not the source data.
